# Unix lab

We will work through the
[Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
material.  Please also be familiar with the
[Unix guide](http://things.maths.cam.ac.uk/computing/learning/ComputingBooklet.pdf)
from the department.


If you are still unfamiliar with unix, I suggest you take the UCS
course
[Introduction to Unix](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/docs/course-notes/unix-courses/UnixCLI).
