## Lecture 2015-10-15 13:00-14:00 MR2

I will go through the following [lecture slides](latex101-4up.pdf).


## Lab 2015-10-15 14:00-15:00 CATAM lab

After the lecture, there will be a lab.  There are 30 seats, of which
20 are prioritised for the MPhil Comp Biology students.  The remaining
spaces will be available on a first-come-first-served basis.  If you
would like to attend a lab, but there is no space, let me (sje30) know
and I can put on another lab, or take your questions in my office
hour.

For the lab session, you need your PWF login details.  We will go
through the following short guide, which I will encourage you to edit
using  a program like `texstudio` or `texmaker`.

Try the following:

1. Put your name and affiliation on the title page.

2. Add a new paragraph of text.

3. Typeset some new equations.

4. Include a new figure with a caption.

5. Format you own table.

If you are stuck for inspiration, try to recreate some of the
equations, tables and figures from
[Robert May's 1976 paper](https://paperpile.com/shared/lVa1BI).
